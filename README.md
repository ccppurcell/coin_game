# Coin game

I made this game as part of the programming-25.mooc.fi python
course. The initial version is what I submitted for the course. I
intend to continue developing this game as an exercise in learning
python.

You are a robot. Avoid the ghosts and collect enough coins to reveal
the exit. Head through the exit to the next level, with more ghosts
and more coins. Can you get to level 10?
